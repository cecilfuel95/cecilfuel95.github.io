# READ ME

## Lists, Links and Images

The objective of this task is to build on your knowledge of HTML through linking pages within your site and adding images.

You are not expected to complete this in one session. What you do not finish in class, spend time practicing at home. Always start from the beginning. Do not copy and paste code; always type it out.

## Instructions

Clone this repository by clicking the "Clone or Download" button, then select "Download ZIP".

Included in the directory on your computer are the following files:

### Here is what you need to do

**All work needs to be done in the `exercise-02` folder.** (It may be named `exercise-02-master`.)

1. In each html file, add the correct document structure around the already marked-up content. Make sure your code nests inside the body tags.

2. In each candidate file, add the candidate's photo. Look for the comment as to where it should be placed on the page. Add emphasis tags to the caption below the image.

3. Under 'Personal Information' in each candidate's file, build a list. Strongly emphasize the categories. Most candidates will require a nested list for their education information.

4. In each html file, under candidates, fix the list so each candidate name (and 'Home') link to their correct HTML file. You should be able to access any other page within your site from any page. Make sure your links do not break!

5. There are several instances where abbreviations are in the text of each page (i.e. B.A., N.Y.). Read about the `abbr` tag and how you might use it to describe these abbreviations in HTML.

### How to tackle this project

Decide what you need to do, one step at a time.

Write down each task as you go. When you complete it, check it off. Decide on the next task to tackle.

Once you get into marking up content within the body, it is okay if you get stuck. Set aside that task and move on to another. Note the item you struggled with (so you can spend time on it later) and keep moving forward.

### Am I done?

Again, it is not expected for you to complete this exercise in class.  If you finish, have your professor give it a look.  If you *are* finished, delete your work and code it again. Practice, repetition is an excellent way to learn.

### Why isn't X working?

Before asking for help, try working through the problem first. Refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

When something does not appear to work as you expect, ask yourself:

  - Did I forget to close a tag?
  - Are there typos in element, attribute, value names?
  - Did I forget to include quotes around attributes?
  - Are my file names, directory paths correct?

Remember, you can always refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

**Good luck!**
